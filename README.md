# Covid-19 Berlin Data Dashboard 

This is a flask app that visualizes data from the city of Berlin Open Data,
on the incidents of Covid-19 in different districts according to date.
A line plot is included where the total number of Covid-19 incidents according
to neighboorhood grouped into seasons are dislplayed. The second graph is a bar
plot with the total number of Covid-19 incidents. The available data are for the
period 03.03.20-26.01.21. The decrease in the incidents from Autumn to Winter is
a result of the fact that for Winter 2020-2021 we have data only for two out of the
three months.
